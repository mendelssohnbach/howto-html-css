        <h2>Selecting HTML To Style</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting the right element and providing the right visual styles is the basis of
          <a href="https://do.co/community">writing CSS</a> code. Whenever you need to adjust how an
          element on a webpage looks, using selectors is key.

        <h2>The Type Selector</h2>
        <p>
          The type selector finds elements on the page by tag name. This is a common way to style
          elements on the page. Type selectors are often referred to as element selectors.

        <h2>Combining Selectors</h2>
        <p>
          A combinator selector is defined by a space character between selectors, with the HTML
          ancestry reading left to right. The right-most selector is the intended target. This can
          be as complex or as simple as necessary to <em>scope</em>, or provide sufficient
          specificity, to the intended element.
