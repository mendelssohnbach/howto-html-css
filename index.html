          Coral reefs are teeming with life. They are known as the
          <em>rainforests of the sea</em> with how many various speieces live within their waters.
          The defining feature of these ecosystems are the plant-like coral, which are really
          colonies of tiny invertabrates called <strong>polyps</strong>.

          Sadly, many reefs around the world are in danger due to rising ocean temperatures,
          pollution, and overfishing.
